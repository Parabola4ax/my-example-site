# SharePoint Site Script samples

You can use Site Scripts to customize how SharePoint sites are being provisioned. To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the action to be applied when site is provisioned. You can also start external flow for the additional actions, if needed.

This is a open source repository to share different kind of Site Scripts between community. Check [**Samples**](./samples) folder for what's currently available. Have you build one which you can share? - **We do welcome contributions**.
