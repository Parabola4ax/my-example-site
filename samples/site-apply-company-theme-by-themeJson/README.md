# Applying custom theme

## Summary

Site script supports applying a custom theme to a site collection by either referencing the theme name or the JSON definition of the theme. The latter is done by the themeJson property. Rather than installing the custom theme to the tenant theme gallery, this property installs the custom theme only to the site collection.

Check out the theme generator at https://aka.ms/spthemebuilder if you need help creating a custom theme.
